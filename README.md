# Running Data Shiny App
This January, I was contacted by the SOA (Society of Actuaries) and asked to provide some 
feedback on their CAA designation (hint: don't get it). They offered to pay me $200 for a 30 minute phone call. 
Absolutely unreal. So, I decided to take my recently acquired nest egg and buy myself a Garmin running watch. 
Four months later, and that watch has accompanied me on every run since. 

I have primarily used Strava to track all my running data. However, the free version of strava is a little basic
so I thought it would be fun to try to build some of the views I wanted to see. Strava has a simple, easy to use API
which allowed me to get to my running data without much trouble.

I was in the middle of an R project at work and my friend Ryan ([@ryanpeiffer](https://github.com/ryanpeiffer)) had previously shown me Shiny and ShinyApps.io (RStudio's
Shiny application hosting service). I thought this would be a great opportunity to give those two applications a try.
